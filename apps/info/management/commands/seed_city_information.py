"""Create a starter set of City Information entries.

The entries describe widely documented, publicly known facts about
Kabankalan City. They are a starting point for a new installation: review and
edit them in the staff dashboard (Admin > City information) so that the public
page matches the official city record. The entries are created **published**,
because they are the curated starter content of the city; unpublish any of
them that should not be public.

    python manage.py seed_city_information           # only when the table is empty
    python manage.py seed_city_information --force   # replace the existing entries
