"""Question-aware search for the Explore Kabankalan catalogue.

The catalogue holds **real places**, so a search has to answer two different
kinds of question honestly:

``"Mag-aso Falls"`` / ``"Kabankalan Plaza"``
    The visitor names a place. The answer is that place - and only that
    place. A query that carries a full place name used to fall back to a
    broad "all titles contain these words" match and could return dozens of
    unrelated records, so the exact title is matched first.

``"where to buy a phone case"``
    The visitor names a **product**, not a place. No listing in Kabankalan
    is called "Phone Case", so a text search finds nothing. The honest answer
    is the *category* that sells such things - the shops and malls - and the
    page says so: the match came from the category, not from a listing name.

Everything in this module is a curated rule over the existing taxonomy. No
external service and no generated data is involved.
